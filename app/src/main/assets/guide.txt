This is an example of a mastermind game:
There are 6 available colors:
White (W), Blue (B), Green (G), Red (R), Yellow (Y), Orange (O)

The code generated by the game:
RBBO (length = 4)

Solution's pattern / Points (BLACK) | [WHITE] per turn:
W W(B)[B] / 1 | 1
WGWG / 0 | 0
[B][R](B)R / 1 | 2
(B)(R)Y(B) / 0 | 3
[R][B][B][O] / 4 | 0 (You won)

Did you figure out how to play ?

--Game introduction--
Mastermind is a puzzle game in which the game will generate a code (in this case, a string of 8 colors)
and you will decode it after some steps (usually 9 steps).

--How to play--
- In each step:
You will have to provide a solution which has the same number of colors (8 in this case) with the code from the available colors.
+ The game will rate your solution's pattern after each turn by 2 types of points:
 . BLACK: This point indicates the number of cells which have the correct order AND color as in the code generated by the game.
 . WHITE: This point indicates the number of cells which are NOT counted as BLACK and have the correct color BUT placed in the wrong order.
- Throughout the game, whenever your BLACK points equals to 8, you'll win.
- After 13 steps, if you still can't solve the code then you will lose the game.
